        One of the many benefits of studying abroad in Spain, is its close
        proximity to other European countries. Flights to France for example,
        can be as cheap as $50. Although my experience was cut short because of
        Covid-19, I was still fortunate enough to visit Lisbon and Milan during
        my abroad semester.
      </p>
      <h3>Lisbon, Portugal</h3>
      <p>
        I chose to visit Lisbon because it is very close to Madrid and is on the
        coast of Portugal. I am from Miami, so I was excited to see the ocean
        again! I rented an Airbnb for the weekend with my roommates and two
        other friends that were studying abroad in Italy. Our round-trip flights
        cost us only 96 Euros. On our first day, we went to a neighborhood
        called Castelo, that is surrounded by a large castle, named SÃ£o Jeorge
        Castle. We ate at a small restaurant and had to order our food in
        Portuguese which was quite challenging. We later entered the castle and
        were able to see incredible views of all of Lisbon. Finally, we walked
        through the neighborhood's beautiful cobblestone paths.
      </p>
      <h3>Milan, Italy</h3>
      <p>
        One of my best friends from Babson was studying abroad in Milan at
        Bocconi University. She invited me to visit her for the weekend and let
        me stay in her apartment. I had never been to Italy so I was very
        excited to take her up on this offer. I found a roundtrip ticket for 130
        Euros to the Milan Malpensa airport and started to plan my trip!
      </p>
      <p>
        My first day there, we visited the Duomo di Milano, a beautiful
        Cathedral in the middle of the city. We ate lunch in the famous Galleria
        Vittorio Emanuele II, a shopping mall next to the duomo. Then, she
        introduced me to the friends she had met in her school, and we spent the
        day walking through the city. Most importantly, that day I got to try
        Milan's delicious gelato! The next day, we woke up early and took a trip
        to Lake Como in Northern Italy. The scenery was incredible so we ate
        lunch by the lake and then walked around the town the rest of the
        afternoon. Although it was a short trip, I loved being able to visit a
        new city and touring it with my friend.

      <h3>The Application Process</h3>
      <p>
        As a first-semester junior in college, I was still unsure of whether I
        wanted to go abroad or not. Growing up, I never went to sleep away camps
        or had any experience with leaving home for such a long period of time,
        other than college. Everyone around me was telling me that I could not
        miss this opportunity to study abroad but I was unsure if I could last
        an entire semester in a different country. I spoke with the study abroad
        counselors and they recommended that I begin to research different
        countries, schools, and programs in order to familiarize myself with the
        options I had.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had never traveled to Europe, so I knew that this would be a great
        opportunity to do so. However, there were so many options to choose from
        that I was overwhelmed pretty quickly. The first country I was
        interested in was Italy because I had heard of how beautiful Florence
        was that it was a small enough city where I would feel comfortable
        within my first few weeks. However, as I learned more about the
        educational programs, they did not really match the classes that I
        wanted to take abroad. While they offered many liberal arts classes, I
        was looking to take business courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I began to look into the differences between doing an exchange
        program through another University, and going with an American program
        with many students from different schools. The study abroad counselor
        mentioned to me that the rigor of an exchange program was much higher,
        and that I would get to meet people from the city I was living in,
        instead of other Americans. I came to the conclusion that this was the
        best option for me, which really got me excited to choose a new city and
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then looked into Spain, because my family is originally from Colombia
        so I speak fluent Spanish. I thought this would be a great country to go
        to because I might find comfort knowing that I will be able to
        communicate easily even if I am in a country I have never been before. I
        narrowed it down to Madrid or Barcelona, but ultimately decided on
        Madrid because of the IE University's prestigious academics, and its
        close proximity to the city.

      <h3>How I found housing</h3>
      <p>
        I was lucky enough to get accepted into IE University with one of my
        best friends from Babson. We decided we would try to find an apartment
        together with one of her friends from her home town, who would also be
        studying abroad in Madrid. We used many companies to find long-term
        rentals, such as
        <a class="link" href="https://www.idealista.com/en/" target="_blank">Idealista</a>
        and
        <a class="link" href="https://www.homeclub.com/en" target="_blank">Homeclub</a>. After a
        couple of weeks, we found the perfect 3-bedroom apartment within our
        budget. It was 7 minute bus ride to IE University, and a 10 minute drive
        to the city. Living in a centralized area really made our experience
        incredible because we had access to all different types of
        transportation, such as the metro and bus, but could also walk to most
        places. The map below shows the route we would take to class, as well as
        the distance into the city. We discovered many nice restaurants, parks
        and bars within walking distance to our apartment which made a new city
        very "homey". All that was left to do was
        <a class="link" href="recommendations.html">choose my classes!</a>

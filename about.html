      <h2>About Yael</h2>
      <p class="para">
        My name is Yael Levy and I had the amazing opportunity of studying
        abroad in Madrid, Spain in the Spring of 2020. Although my experience
        got cut short because of the Covid-19 pandemic, I would still love to
        spread the knowledge I gained from the application process, to finding
        housing, and finally, my academic journey abroad for anyone that is
        interested in doing the same, or simply going to visit Madrid.

        I am now a second semester senior and can confidently say that my
        education abroad experience is one that I will never forget. I had never
        been to Europe before and was not only able to live in Madrid, but also
        travel to other European countries for amazing prices.

        When studying abroad, you have the choice to do an exchange program with
        an approved University, or to join a program with other study abroad
        students from all around the United States. Although more competitive, I
        chose to do an exchange program at IE University, where I was taking a
        typical second semester junior class load as a regular student at IE
        would take. This made the classes challenging but also rewarding and
        gave me the opportunity to meet students from almost every country.
